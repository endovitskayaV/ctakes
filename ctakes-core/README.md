Before running Java code add umlsKey as environment variable. You can get it
from [UMLS profile page](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/profile)(you need to
be [registered](https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/uts/signup-login) - a license request needs to be filled - do it properly or
it won`t be accepted) or contact [Valentina Endovitskaya](mailto:evvendovitskaya@yandex.ru) to get her key.
